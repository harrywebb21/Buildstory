			Building stuff is hard. At times, really hard. While the road of an indie hacker isn’t an easy
			one, for many of us, there’s no other way.
		</p>
		<p class=" text-slate-400">
			In our experience, there’s one surefire way to make the journey much more enjoyable,
			successful and rewarding: by going at it with a community at your side.
		</p>
		<p class=" text-slate-200">
			That’s why we’re building Buildstory—to create a place where indie hackers can connect, build
			and ship, together. Built by Builders, for Builders.
		</p>
		<p class="  text-slate-400">
			There are already some wonderful places for indie hackers to connect with likeminded folks,
			but in our experience, it can be incredibly difficult to do so: for instance, if you have less
			than 1,000 followers on Twitter it often feels you’re screaming into the void.
		</p>
		<p class=" text-slate-200">
			We think it doesn’t have to be that way. Our vision for Buildstory is to create a platform
			that doesn't prioritize engaging content solely for the sake of an algorithm that generates ad
			revenue.
		</p>
		<p class=" text-slate-400">
			Instead, we want Buildstory to be a place where everyone can share their insights, ideas, and
			projects without getting lost in the noise. Together, we can amplify each other's signals and
			create a thriving community for indie hackers.
		</p>
		<p class="  text-slate-200">
			Like the idea? We’d love to have you on board as a founding member.
